# HackathonDemo

Demo application used for demonstrating how to build an Android application.

## Slides

Normally I live code this demo, but if I can't, I will use the slides at [here](intro_to_android/intro_to_android.pdf).

## DISCLAIMER

At this moment in time, the slides are out of date. We now have AndroidX instead of the support library, Android Studio has had some major version bumps. A lot of what's there will apply, but beware that some things may appear different if you tried to follow along today.
